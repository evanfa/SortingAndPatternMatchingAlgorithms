SortingAndPatternMatchingAlgorithms
=================

Includes sorting/finding algorithms and a test case for each project ("Main.java" tests their execution time by increased item size via mentioned those test cases).

Sorting Algorithms:
* Bubblesort
* Heapsort
* Insertionsort
* Mergesort
* Quicksort
* Selectionsort

Pattern Matching Algorithms:
* Brute Force
* Horspool
